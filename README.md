## App Links

- **Download from [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.newslogist.gameologist)**
- **Coming soon on the App Store**

## Getting Started

> **Note**: Ensure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions up to the "Creating a new application" step before proceeding.

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/scizard-projects/gameologist.git
cd gameologist
```

## Step 2: Install node modules

```bash
npm install
```

## Step 3: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
npm start
```

## Step 4: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
npm run android
```

### For iOS

```bash
npm run ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run the app. :partying_face:
